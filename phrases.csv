Transcription directed across H-NS binding regions relieves H-NS-mediated (and H-NS/StpA-mediated) repression of promoters such as <i>proV</i>p3, <i>pdeL</i>p3, and <i>appY</i>p2, and there is a correlation between transcription across the H-NS-bound region and derepression where RNA polymerase is able to remodel the H-NS complex and/or dislodge H-NS from the DNA and thus relieve repression |CITS:[RDBECOLIPRC18945]|.
